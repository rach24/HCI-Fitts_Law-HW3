# HCI-Fitts_Law-HW3
Validating Fitt's law that predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function   of   the   ratio   between   the   distance   to   the   target   and   the   width   of   the   target.

● Developed   a    2D   pointing,   multi-directional    tapping   application   with   different   target   sizes   and   distances.

● Users tap the targets quickly and as accurately as possible. After all targets clicked once, new round
starts   with   target   size   and   distance   changed.

● Results stored in a JSON file and a python script created to visualize graphs and verify Fitts’s Law.
